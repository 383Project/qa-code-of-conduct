## Quality Assurance Regression Testing
One of the most important aspects of quality assurance is regression testing. Regression testing is the process of testing a software application to ensure that new changes or updates to the application have not introduced any new bugs or issues.
## Importance of Regression Testing
Regression testing is essential for ensuring that the quality of the software is maintained throughout the development process. Software applications are complex and consist of multiple components that interact with each other. Any changes or updates to one component can have unintended consequences on other components. Regression testing ensures that the changes made to one component do not affect the overall functioning of the application.
## Type of Regression Testing
We perform Manual regression testing testing the application to ensure that it still functions correctly after changes are made.
## How we implement Regression Testing
Regression testing is included in so many different situations within our product deliveries. We regression test apps if they’re going through a software update. We regression test our products at the end of each Sprint to ensure that phase of delivery to the client is of good quality. Anytime there is an improvement/functional change or upgrade we run a relevant regression test script to ensure we’re delivering the best possible quality product.
## Conclusion
In conclusion, regression testing is a critical aspect of quality assurance. It helps to ensure that software applications are functioning correctly and meeting the needs of their users. Whether using manual or automated testing methods, regression testing should be a regular part of the development process to ensure that software applications are of the highest quality.
