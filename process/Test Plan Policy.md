# Test Plan Policy

This Test Plan Policy is implemented to provide guidelines for the QA Team at 383 to understand the reasoning and process behind writing Test Plans for project and product work. 

## Purpose
Test plans are essential in ensuring that software or products meet the required standards and specifications. These plans outline the steps that will be taken to test a product, including the entry & exit criteria and how those results will be measured.

## Scope
This policy applies to all software products at 383.

## Test Plan Steps
1. The first step in creating a test plan is to understand the requirements of the software. The QA team ensures they have a clear understanding of what the software is supposed to do and how it should behave. They also understand the needs of the end-users and the environment in which the software will be used. The Test Plans start off with an Overview and Purpose section to demonstrate the QA Analysts understanding. This information helps them to then create test cases that are relevant and meaningful.

2. The next step is to define the scope of the testing. The QA team identify what areas of the software will be tested and what types of tests will be conducted. They also consider what types of defects they are looking for and how they will be classified. This step is crucial in ensuring that the testing is comprehensive and that all potential issues are identified.

3. Once the scope has been defined, the QA team can create test cases. Test cases are specific scenarios that are designed to test the functionality of the software. They are detailed and include information such as the expected results and the steps required to execute the test. The QA analyst ensures that their test cases cover all aspects of the software and that they are relevant to the end-users.

4. The test plan then also details the following: 
      1. Entry criteria: Entry criteria, also known as test initiation criteria, refers to the set of conditions that must be met before testing can begin.          These criteria ensure that the software is in a stable and testable state and that the testing can proceed effectively and efficiently.
      2. Exit criteria: Exit criteria, also known as test completion criteria, refer to the conditions that must be met before testing can          be              considered complete and the software can be released. These criteria are established to ensure that the software has been adequately tested and            meets the quality standards and requirements of the stakeholders.
      3. Suspension criteria: Suspension criteria refers to the conditions or circumstances under which the testing of software is temporarily halted or            suspended. The suspension of software testing is usually done to address issues that have been discovered during the testing process or to allow            for changes to be made to the software.
      4. Key assumptions:
      5. Other assumptions:

      7. Test approach:
