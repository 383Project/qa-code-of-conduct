This Test Plan Policy is implemented to provide guidelines for the QA Team at 383 to understand the reasoning and process behind writing Test Plans for project and product work.

## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for writing Test Plans at 383. 
Test plans are essential in ensuring that software or products meet the required standards and specifications. These plans outline the steps that will be taken to test a product, including the expected results and how those results will be measured.

## Scope
This policy applies to all software products at 383.

## Test Plan process
1. The QA Analyst involved in the project/product must understand the software requirements, including but not limited to:
      1. Clarifying what the software should do and how it should behave.
      2. Understanding the needs of the end-users and the environment.
2. Using that knowledge an Overview and Purpose must be added into the Test Plan
3. A Scope section must be created identifying what areas of the software will be tested and how any defects found will be classified. 
4. The Test Plan must detail when Test Cases will be created:
      1. In the case of a fixed process build these must be created sometime prior to the QA phase. 
      2. In the case of a flexible process build these must be created early on within each sprint before the QA phase of that sprint. 
5. The Test Plan must detail the information the Test Cases must include i.e:
      1. Steps required to execute the test
      2. Expected results of the test
      3. Any relevant links to customer requirements (if applicable) 
      4. All aspects of the software
      5. Be relevant to the end-user
6. Entry Criteria must be included in the Test Plan and must detail:
      1. A set of conditions that must be met before testing can begin
7. Exit Criteria must be included in the Test Plan and must detail:
      1. A set of conditions that must be met before testing is considered complete and the software released
8. Suspension Criteria must be included in the Test Plan and must detail:
      1. The conditions or circumstances under which the testing of software can be temporarily halted or suspended.
9. Key Assumptions must be included in the Test Plan and must detail:
      1. Prerequisite setup
      2. Client requirements 
      3. Traceability
      4. Mitigation of risks
10. A Test Approach must be included in the Test Plan and must detail:
      1. All methods testing used.
      2. Descriptions of how those methods will be used
11. Testing Deliverables must be included in the Test Plan and must detail:
      1. Defect Reports
      2. Defect Management
      3. Test Cases
      4. Test Reports

## Peer Review
Upon completion of the Test Plan it will be sent for a peer review to a more senior member of the QA team. Any amendments will need to be made prior to this Test Plan being sent to the Project Manager and project team.

## Conclusion
Our QA team plays a critical role in the software development process. Creating test plans is an essential part of their job, and it requires a deep understanding of the software requirements, test scope, and the creation of test cases. Test plans help to ensure that the software is of high quality and meets the needs of the end-users.
