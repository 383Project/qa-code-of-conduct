# Quality Assurance Defect Creation
Defect Creation is a vital part of the Quality Assurance process, it ultimately allows for the documentation and fixing of issues when releasing products into the world.
## How do we implement Defect Creation
Defect creation is a formal process with instructions created to ensure each created defect contains the same information so the developer is able to recreate and fix the defect. The QA team create defects with a combination of steps to reproduce and evidence in the form of either a screenshot or video.
## Conclusion
In conclusion, quality assurance defect creation is a common occurrence in software development. Lack of communication, insufficient testing, and human error are some of the common causes of quality assurance defect creation. To minimise the occurrence of defects, it is crucial to establish effective communication channels, carry out sufficient testing, and provide adequate training to the quality assurance team.
