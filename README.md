## What is manual Quality Assurance?

Manual quality assurance (QA) is a process of verifying that a product or service meets a set of predetermined quality standards through manual inspection and testing. In this process, trained human testers examine the product or service to identify any defects or issues that may negatively impact the user experience.

Manual QA typically involves the following steps:

1. Defining the requirements: The first step is to define the quality standards or requirements that the product or service must meet. These requirements can include functional requirements, performance requirements, security requirements, usability requirements, and so on.

2. Designing test cases: Testers create test cases that outline the specific steps they will take to test the product or service against the defined requirements. Each test case typically includes a set of inputs, expected outputs, and the expected behavior of the product or service.

3. Executing test cases: Testers manually execute the test cases, following the steps outlined in each one. They observe the behavior of the product or service and record any issues or defects that they encounter.

4. Reporting and tracking defects: Testers report any issues or defects they find during testing and track them until they are resolved.

At 383 our QA process involves all of these and more.
